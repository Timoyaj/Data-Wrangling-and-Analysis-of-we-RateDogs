# Data-Wrangling-and-Analysis-of-we-RateDogs
Project Wrangle and Analyze data was the second project carried out during the ALX -Udacity Nanodegree in Data Analytics
Real-world data rarely come clean. Using Python and its libraries, i will gathered data from various sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it this is called data wrangling. 
The dataset that I wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs, Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. Details here
